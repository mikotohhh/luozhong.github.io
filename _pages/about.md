Update: I am now a Master student in Computer Science Engineering at Harvard University (A whisper is that Boston has more fun than Madison!). 

I earned my Bachlor's degree in CS at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My reseaerch goal is to build secure and reliable systems. 

Research Focus
======
My research interests include:
- System & Software Security
- System Reliability
- System Performance 

Current Work 
======
- I am now building a LLM application aims to provide an alternative and efficient search mechanism for academic papers, specifically for researchers whose work depends heavily on dataset. 

Past Work
======
- I worked with Prof. Barton Miller and Prof. Sean Peisert (LBNL) on software tampering detection in nuclear arm reduction treaty. Our work has been summarized in an interesting [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05946)

- [uFS](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Software/uFS/) is a (semi)microkernel high-performance filesystem developed by ADSL(UW-Madison), my contribution included improvement on its reliability and fault tolerance ability.

- I contributed to the state of the art GPU database [crystal](https://github.com/anilshanbhag/crystal).
